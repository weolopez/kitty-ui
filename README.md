# Ghostty Graphics (TypeScript/Deno)

This directory contains a reimplementation of the Ghostty Graphics project in TypeScript using Deno 2.

The codebase is structured into three main parts:

- `src/lib`: The UI library framework.
- `src/app`: The application code that loads a scene graph file and renders the scene.
- `src/test`: Test files for the UI library and application code.

## Getting Started

TODO: Add instructions for setting up Deno and running the application/tests.
